When there is more than one app that responds to your implicit intent, the user can select which app to use and make that app the default choice for the action. The ability to select a default is helpful when performing an action for which the user probably wants to use the same app every time, such as when opening a web page (users often prefer just one web browser).
However, if multiple apps can respond to the intent and the user might want to use a different app each time, you should explicitly show a chooser dialog. The chooser dialog asks the user to select which app to use for the action (the user cannot select a default app for the action). For example, when your app performs "share" with the ACTION_SEND action, users may want to share using a different app depending on their current situation, so you should always use the chooser dialog, as shown in Figure 2.
To show the chooser, create an Intent using createChooser() and pass it to startActivity(), as shown in the following example. This example displays a dialog with a list of apps that respond to the intent passed to the createChooser() method and uses the supplied text as the dialog title.
